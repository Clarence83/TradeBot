# TradeBot
Crypto trading bot using Binance API

The bot uses a Binance API key to get live charts and history for the top 5 crypto coins on https://www.binance.com/en.

The bot uses RSI and MACD, Bollinger Bands indicators to generate and filter buy signals. The bot automatically places buy limit orders with a minimum bid, take-profit, and trailing stop-loss. The bot constantly monitors all of its positions for close signals (based on indicators, take-profit or stop-loss).

The aim of this project is to create a profitable live trading bot (with paper trading functionality).
