# TradeBot
Crypto trading bot using Binance API

The bot uses a Binance API key to get live charts and history.

The bot uses RSI and MACD, Bollinger Bands indicators to generate and filter buy signals. The bot automatically places buy market orders with a trailing stop-loss. The bot constantly monitors all of its positions for close signals.

The aim of this project is to create a profitable live trading bot (with paper trading and backtesting functionality).
